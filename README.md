# Starship
Starship is an interface framework for building responsive, card-based layouts and the main style system behind [WebCode.How](https://webcode.how). There's still some issues with grid system reusability, so be careful if using it in your own sites. However, the cards system works relatively well regardless of grid usage.

Want to contribute? Send a PR and we'll take a look. We especially need help documenting this style system.
